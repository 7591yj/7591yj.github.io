### Project Overview

`tg-webm-converter` is a Python CLI tool designed to automate the conversion of image and video files into WebM format, adhering to Telegram's specific sticker and icon requirements.

Originating from a personal need to streamline sticker creation, this tool eliminates manual conversion steps, allowing users to effortlessly generate static and animated stickers for a unified sticker pack experience.

It is distributed via PyPI, making it accessible for broader use across various operating systems.

### Technical Stack

- **Python** for Core application logic and CLI interface.
- **Poetry** for Dependency management and project packaging.
- **FFmpeg** for High-performance media processing and optimization.

### Key Features

- Batch Conversion
- Telegram Sticker Compliance:
  - Generates 512x512 WebM stickers (max 256KB).
  - Generates 100x100 WebM icons (max 32KB) via dedicated `--icon-file` argument.
- Automatic Optimization
  - Leverages FFmpeg for efficient encoding and size reduction, ensuring files meet Telegram's strict size limits without manual intervention.
- Cross-Platform Accessibility
  - Rewritten from a shell script into a Python CLI for compatibility beyond `bash`/`zsh` environments, including Windows.
- Streamlined Workflow
  - Simplifies the process of creating custom Telegram stickers programmatically, replacing complex manual FFmpeg commands.

### Problem Solved

As a Telegram user myself, the process of manually converting media files to meet Telegram's sticker specifications and
managing separate static and dynamic sticker packs presented a significant friction point.

`tg-webm-converter` addresses these challenges by:

1.  **Automating tedious conversions:** eliminates the need for graphic tools or complex FFmpeg commands.
2.  **Enabling unified sticker packs:** converts all media to WebM, allowing both static and dynamic elements within a single sticker pack.
3.  **Providing an accessible solution:** offers a user-friendly CLI tool installable via `pip`, making it available to a wider audience.

### Highlights

Developed with Python 3.8+, `tg-webm-converter` integrates robust argument parsing for targeted conversions and supports directory-wide processing.

Its release on PyPI facilitates easy installation (`pip install tg-webm-converter`).

Future enhancements such as GUI support and performance optimizations for large-scale batches are to be seen.
