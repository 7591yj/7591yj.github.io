### Project Overview

#### Plug-and-play 3D printer accessories, designed for seamless performance and compatibility.

HW/SW solution for managing 3D printer farms. Easy-to-use admin dashboard, infinite compatibility, and infinite scalability.

### Technical Stack

#### Hardware

The hardware, **modulino-hub**, is a plug-and-play integrated control hub that adds smart functionality to existing 3D printers through a simple USB connection.

It provides universal compatibility without complex installation or printer modification,
and its modular expandable architecture allows for custom feature configuration based on user needs.

The system aims to simultaneously enhance the safety, efficiency, and convenience of 3D printer farm operations.

Peripheral hardware modules designed for the modulino-hub, **modulino-parts** are what makes these special.
They are the modules that provide additional features to the printers. Plug them into modulino-hub, and right away you have a new feature to your existing printer.

#### Software

The software, **modulino-system**, is a local server-based control program designed to efficiently integrate
and monitor multiple distributed hub modules (hereafter “devices”) through a single unified interface.

It ensures stable operation even in complex network environments and aims to eliminate device management complexity
and maximize operational efficiency through an intuitive user experience.

modulino-system is designed as **dashboard-first UI**, providing printer management team a simple but powerful set of features just a click away.

##### Frontend

- **Svelte 5 + SvelteKit 2:** used for building fast, reactive, component-based web UIs with minimal overhead.
- **Vite:** provides ultra-fast dev server and optimized build pipeline leveraging native ES modules.
- **Zod:** enables schema-based type-safe validation directly in TypeScript, improving data integrity.
- **Flowbite-Svelte:** provides a collection of ready-to-use components built with Svelte, Tailwind CSS, and Alpine.js.
- **TailwindCSS:** provides utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **socket.io-client:** provides real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication between client and server.
- **TypeScript + ESLint + Prettier + svelte-check:** enforces code consistency, catches type and lint errors early, and maintains formatting across the monorepo.

##### Backend

- **Express:** provides a fast, unopinionated, and minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- **socket.io-server:** handles real-time event-based communication.
- **tsx + TypeScript:** allows TypeScript-native execution and modern ECMAScript support without a custom build pipeline.

##### Others

- **Protobuf.js:** provides a fast, efficient, and easy-to-use protocol buffer implementation for JavaScript.
- **pnpm:** provides workspace management and monorepo support.

### Key Features

- 3D printer farm management on web-based dashboard
- Ability to add/delete printers to the system with carefully designed PnP experience
- Ability to fluently add/delete new features to nearly every printer in the market
- Notifications and automated initial response right at the time when something goes wrong

### Problem Solved

The traditional method of production, which involves manufacturing molds before production, has high initial costs.
As production volume increases, the unit cost of production decreases, making it suitable for mass production rather than small-batch manufacturing.
In contrast, the 3D printing method has low initial costs and shows high efficiency in multi-variety, small-lot production.

As a result, the frequency of using maker spaces or outsourced printing services for
small-scale production and prototyping purposes has increased. With the expansion of this market,
there has also been a growing trend toward establishing 3D printer farms.

But nothing is perfect. To really make 3D printer farms industry-ready, every farm needs a way of managing the whole farm as one system.
In the case of maker spaces or outsourced printing services, **a small number of personnel are typically responsible for managing multiple printers**.
However, since printing is often done with models that have different conditions each time, there are no standardized operating parameters,
and as a result, a wide range of potential issues can arise.

And the real issue is, that **a farm may require some specific functions**, which in many cases will not be included in the 3D printer,
especially those that are not the flagships of one brand.

To add that one last piece of the puzzle, there are two options:

- Use a high-end flagship printer
  - Additional functions can be used immediately without modification, but...
  - The cost of purchasing the printer is high
  - Functions are tied to specific models
  - Financial burden

- Use optional expansion kits
  - Desired functions can be added separately, but...
  - Compatibility issues may arise between the expansion kit and the 3D printer
  - The modification process requires technical expertise
  - There is a risk of device malfunction during modification

As seen above, **both are not a real trustworthy solution** for maker spaces and outsourced printing services.

Compatibility is a huge problem. It is truly hard to make those changes yourself one by one, and they break the warranty.
It is hard to manage the printers as one farm. It is hard to troubleshoot if anything goes wrong.

modulino solves this problem of dealing with troublesome printers by:

Managing multiple printers individually wastes time and introduces errors.
modulino centralizes every printer into a **single dashboard** — track jobs, monitor runtime, assign tasks, and identify issues instantly.

modulino works with your existing printers through a USB hardware module.
**No proprietary hardware required.** Add functions, automate prints, receive alerts the moment something fails — all from one interface.

### Highlights

- **Universal Compatibility**
  Works with virtually any 3D printer through a simple USB connection. No firmware modification or technical setup required.

- **Plug-and-Play Modularity**
  Extend functionality instantly with add-on hardware modules (modulino-parts). Add sensors, automation, and safety features without downtime.

- **Unified Farm Management**
  Monitor and control multiple printers within a single dashboard. Manage print queues, performance metrics, and alerts across all connected devices.

- **Scalability by Design:**
  Built to handle one printer or hundreds. modulino adapts seamlessly as operations grow, without changes to existing infrastructure.

- **Real-Time Feedback and Control:**
  Live communication between backend and devices via Socket.IO ensures instant updates, device status sync, and rapid error detection.

- **Secure Local Control:**
  Operates on a local network for improved reliability and privacy. Cloud dependency is optional, not required.

- **Performance and Efficiency:**
  Protobuf-based message handling and real-time communication reduce latency and bandwidth usage, even in dense printer environments.

- **Dashboard-First Architecture:**
  Optimized for usability and speed. Every printer operation, update, and configuration is one click away.

- **Future-Proof Design:**
  Modular hardware, extensible software, and open architecture provide longevity, adaptability, and long-term support potential.
